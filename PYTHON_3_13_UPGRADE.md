# Python 3.13 Upgrade Guide

This document describes the changes made to upgrade the Health Appointment System to Python 3.13 compatibility.

## Upgraded Features

### 1. Self-Documenting F-Strings (Python 3.12+)

```python
# Before
logger.info(f"Processing appointment {appointment_id} for doctor {doctor_id}")

# After - More readable
logger.info(f"{appointment_id=} processed by doctor {doctor_id=}")
```

### 2. Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)

```python
# Before
if action == 'approve':
    doctor.verification_status = VerificationStatus.VERIFIED
elif action == 'reject':
    doctor.verification_status = VerificationStatus.REJECTED
else:
    # handle default case

# After - Cleaner structure
match action:
    case 'approve':
        doctor.verification_status = VerificationStatus.VERIFIED
    case 'reject':
        doctor.verification_status = VerificationStatus.REJECTED
    case _:
        # handle default case
```

### 3. Improved Type Hints (Python 3.9+)

```python
# Before (Python 3.8 or earlier)
from typing import List, Dict
def get_appointments(doctor_id: int) -> List[Appointment]:
    ...

# After (Python 3.9+)
def get_appointments(doctor_id: int) -> list[Appointment]:
    ...
```

### 4. Enhanced Class Methods

- Added helpful utility methods to models
- Added proper type annotations to method signatures
- Improved `__repr__` methods with more detailed information

## Files Modified

1. **utils.py**
   - Updated to use self-documenting f-strings
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved logging

2. **routes.py**
   - Updated to use pattern matching for control flow
   - Enhanced notification counting with assignment expressions
   - Improved logging

3. **models.py**
   - Added type hints to method signatures
   - Added utility methods for User class
   - Improved string representations

## Testing

A compatibility checker script (`check_python313_compatibility.py`) has been created to verify that all features work correctly with Python 3.13.

## Known Issues

- The current environment is running Python 3.9, which does not support the pattern matching features.
- To fully utilize these features, you need to create a virtual environment with Python 3.13.

## Setting Up Python 3.13

1. Install Python 3.13 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.13 -m venv venv_py313
   source venv_py313/bin/activate  # On Unix/MacOS
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the compatibility checker:
   ```bash
   python check_python313_compatibility.py
   ```

## Benefits of Upgrading

- **Better Performance**: Python 3.11+ offers significant performance improvements
- **Cleaner Code**: Pattern matching and self-documenting f-strings improve readability
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved exception groups and error reporting
- **Modern Syntax**: Access to the latest Python language features
